# Plant Disease Detector ðŸŒ±

A web application that uses machine learning and React to detect diseases in plant leaves from uploaded images.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses TensorFlow/Keras deep learning model to identify plant diseases
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern React frontend with drag-and-drop image upload
- **Real-time Analysis**: Fast disease detection with confidence scores
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Provides actionable advice for each detected condition
- **Multiple Disease Support**: Detects common plant diseases including:
  - Bacterial Spot
  - Early Blight
  - Late Blight
  - Leaf Mold
  - Septoria Leaf Spot
  - Spider Mites
  - Target Spot
  - Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
  - Mosaic Virus

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- pip

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Navigate to Project

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd plant-disease-detector
```

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Upload an Image**: 
   - Drag and drop a leaf image onto the upload area, or
   - Click to browse and select an image file

3. **View Results**: 
   - Wait for the AI analysis to complete
   - Review the detected disease and confidence score
   - Read the treatment recommendations

4. **Upload Another**: Click "Upload Another Image" to analyze more plants

## API Endpoints

### Backend API (FastAPI)

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /health` - Detailed health status
- `POST /api/detect` - Upload image for disease detection
- `GET /api/diseases` - List of supported diseases

### Example API Usage

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Disease detection (with image file)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/detect" \
     -H "accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
     -F "file=@path/to/leaf/image.jpg"
```

## Development

### Adding New Diseases

1. Update the `class_names` list in `backend/models/disease_detector.py`
2. Add corresponding treatment recommendations to the `recommendations` dictionary
3. Retrain or update the ML model to recognize the new disease

### Customizing the UI

- Modify components in `frontend/src/components/`
- Update styling in the respective `.css` files
- Adjust the main layout in `frontend/src/App.tsx`

### Model Improvements

- Replace the demo model with a trained model by updating `backend/models/disease_detector.py`
- Add more sophisticated image preprocessing in `backend/utils/image_processor.py`
- Implement model versioning and A/B testing

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React 18
- TypeScript
- CSS3 with modern features (backdrop-filter, gradients)
- Drag-and-drop file upload

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python web framework)
- TensorFlow/Keras (ML framework)
- Pillow (Image processing)
- OpenCV (Computer vision)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)

### ML/AI
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Transfer learning capabilities

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

### Production Considerations

- Use a production-ready web server (nginx) for the frontend
- Use a production ASGI server (gunicorn with uvicorn workers) for the backend
- Add proper logging and monitoring
- Implement rate limiting and security measures
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Add SSL/TLS certificates
